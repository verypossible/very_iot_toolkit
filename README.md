# Very IoT Toolkit
Toolkit for IoT development Very style.

This toolkit has no opinions about how you go about your work as an IoT
engineer.  Instead, it is a collection of tools and documentation that you can
put into your workflow however you see fit.

## How Do I Use This?
This repository contains tools grouped by hardware platform.  The tools may be
hardware tools that make physical tasks easier, or software tools that make
development tasks easier, or (in true IoT fashion) both.

Check out [generic](./generic) tools that might be useful across all platforms,
or navigate to the platform you are currently working on:

* [Raspberry Pi 3](./rpi)
* [Raspberry Pi 0(w)](./rpi0)
* [ESP8266](./esp8266)
